Project Summary
</h2>
<div style="text-align: left">
<p> This capstone project examines how smartwatches—specifically the Samsung Galaxy Watch8 and Apple Watch Series 11—are reshaping personal health monitoring. As wearable technologies blur the line between consumer electronics and medical devices, the study explores their features, accuracy, public perception, healthcare provider opinions, and legal implications. </p>

<p>The project highlights both promise and limitations: while smartwatches offer tools like ECG, heart rate tracking, sleep analysis, and blood pressure monitoring, their accuracy varies depending on the metric and context. Public opinion is largely positive, especially among younger, affluent users, but healthcare providers remain cautious about usability, privacy, and reliability. Legal frameworks also lag behind, with hybrid devices often falling outside traditional medical regulations.</p>

<p>By synthesizing literature reviews, case studies, and product analyses, the project underscores that smartwatches should complement—not replace—clinical tools. Its goal is to provide a balanced perspective on how these devices can empower preventive care, inform patient-provider interactions, and guide future regulation in the rapidly evolving health technology landscape. </p> </div>
